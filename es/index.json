As in many other planted areas of the Southern Hemisphere, there is great concern about increasing landscape flammability. We determined, under lab conditions, live fuel moisture content (LFMC) and leaf ignition of these conifers, a naturalized poplar, and 13 native species. The mean LFMC was inversely related to leaf ignition of these species. The conifer LFMC was lower than that of most natives, making the conifers the most ignitable species. Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii showed the spring dip phenomenon (i.e., low LFMC in early spring). Leaf ignition and LFMC may help elucidate some flammability components at species levels. At landscape scales, however, they have to be evaluated along with other landscape traits such as structure and stand composition. Understanding this landscape context will require full-scale experimental fires. Nevertheless, our results provide useful information for fire danger assessment, and also for setting policies aimed at planning and applying appropriate silvicultural techniques for fire prevention and control, and hence reducing fire danger at stand or landscape levels.","tags":["flammability","pine plantation","fuel management","forest fires","leaf traits"],"title":"Comparison of Leaf Moisture Content and Ignition Characteristics among Native Species and Exotic Conifers in Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leandro M.

In the south of Mendoza (Argentina), the Llancanelo lagoon constitutes a Ramsar site of continental importance and hosts a great diversity of birds, the Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) being particularly abundant. The monitoring of species, in the long term, and its link with the hydrological variability in wetlands is essential to develop strategies for the protection and management of wildlife and its environment. Here we evaluated the relationship between abundance and breeding of the Chilean Flamingo with the variations of Llancanelo lagoon size, defined as the surface covered by water. The size of the lagoon was estimated from an index applied to Landsat images, the MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index), from 1987 to 2016. The available information allowed a 30-year analysis of data on the abundance of flamingos and breeding events. The results show that breeding colonies are established when there are large concentrations of individuals. The abundance of flamingos and the water surface area have a positive and linear relationship up to a lake size of 80 km2. Beyond this threshold, if the area of the wetland increases, the number of individuals decreases significantly. Long-term monitoring can complement the management of water resources in the upper reaches of the basin and the conservation of Chilean Flamingos in the Llancanelo lagoon.","tags":["Argentina","Chilean Flamingo","Habitat measuring","Population dynamics","Remote Sensing"],"title":"Effects of hydrological variation on the population dynamics of Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) at the Ramsar site Llancanelo lagoon, Mendoza, Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536462000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1536462000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://lucasbianchi.github.io/es/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-03:00","relpermalink":"/es/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Lucas O.

In this region, Laguna Llancanelo collects the water inputs from the Malargüe endorheic basin. Previous studies concerning the annual and intra-annual variations of this lagoon and its relationship with regional climate are rare. We obtained a monthly record for the Laguna Llancanelo area (LLA, 1984–2013) using the modified normalized difference water index derived from Landsat images. Monthly LLA ranges between 35 km2 and 411 km2 and is significantly related to variations of the Río Malargüe, the main snow-fed tributary to the lagoon. There is no long-term relationship between LLA and local rainfall, but rapid increases in LLA result from heavy rainfall around the lagoon. Conversely, rapid reductions in LLA encompass periods with both reduced discharge from the Río Malargüe and low local rainfall. The LLA integrates moisture of both Pacific (snowfall in the upper Andes) and Atlantic (lowland rainfall) origins; therefore, we propose using LLA as an indicator of regional water balance","tags":["Lagoon area fluctuations","remote sensing","hydrometeorological index","climate variability","southern Andes","Laguna Llancanelo","Ramsar site"],"title":"A regional water balance indicator inferred from satellite images of an Andean endorheic basin in central-western Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461726000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1461726000,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://lucasbianchi.github.io/es/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-03:00","relpermalink":"/es/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Species investigated were the native trees ñire (*Nothofagus antarctica*) and cypress (*Austrocedrus chilensis*), the understorey tree-like radal (*Lomatia hirsuta*) and laura (*Schinus patagonicus*), the bamboo caña colihue (*Chusquea culeou*), and the non-native black poplar (*Populus nigra*). LFMC differed among species, with caña colihue having lower values (LFMCñire  radal  cypress  laura  black poplar) and were inversely related to LFMC. Correlations between LFMC and environmental variables were highly significant for caña colihue, significant for ñire, radal, and laura, and weakly significant or non-significant for cypress and black poplar. These results contribute to our understanding of fire behaviour, and validate the fuel typology for Patagonian forests. At the same time, they add some useful knowledge for comparison with other fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems around the world.","tags":["Fire behaviour","Foliar moisture","Patagonian forests","wildfires"],"title":"Live fuel moisture content and leaf ignition of forest species in Andean Patagonia, Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas O.

This index is being adapted to the Argentinean ecosystems since the year 2000. With the objective of calibrating the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) of the FWI system to Patagonian forests, we studied the relationship between ignition probability and fine dead surface fuel moisture content (MC) as an indicator of potential fire ignition. *Area of study*: The study area is located in northwestern Patagonia, Argentina, and comprised two main forest types (cypress and ñire) grown under a Mediterranean climate, with a dry summer and precipitations during winter and autumn (~500-800 mm per year). *Material and methods*: We conducted lab ignition tests fires to determine the threshold of fine dead fuel ignition at different MC levels. Moisture content of dead fine surface fuels in the field was measured every 10-15 days from November to March for three seasons. We calculated the FFMC during these seasons and correlated it with the measured MC by applying a logistic regression model. We combined the results of the ignition tests and of the regressions to suggest FFMC categories for estimating fire danger in Patagonian forests. *Main results*: The ignition threshold occurred at MC values of 21.5 and 25.0% for cypress and ñire sites, respectively. The MC measured varied from 7.3 to 129.6%, and the calculated FFMC varied between 13.4 and 92.6. Highly significant regressions resulted when FFMC was related to MC. The ignition threshold corresponded to a FFMC = 85. We proposed to divide the FFMC scale in three fire danger categories: Low (FFMC ≤ 85), High (85 89). *Research highlights*: Our results provide a useful tool for predicting fire danger in these ecosystems, and are a contribution to the development of the Argentinean Fire Danger Rating and a reference for similar studies in other countries where the FWI is being implemented.","tags":["*Austrocedrus chilensis*","*Nothofagus antarctica*","Wildfire","Fire behavior","Fuel moisture","Fire weather index"],"title":"Ignition probability of fine dead surface fuels in native Patagonia forests of Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria M.

In March 2007 all plots were burned by a wildfire that presented extreme fire behaviour. Three weeks after the wildfire we assessed mortality, height of scorch and percentage of crown scorch, and during three subsequent growing seasons we measured mortality and growth parameters. At the end of the study, mortality differed significantly among treatments and an untreated control, and ranged from 100% in the untreated control to 25, 10 and 5% in the SDI 900, 700 and 500 treatments. The highest growth parameters and lower mortality rates were achieved at SDI indices of 700 or 500 (i.e. in the least dense plots). Trees thinned to these densities not only appear to withstand extreme fires, at least under the conditions presented, but also to achieve the highest growth rates","tags":["extreme fire behaviour","fuel management","Reineke’s index","silvicultural treatments"],"title":"Fire-caused tree mortality in thinned Douglas-fir stands in Patagonia, Argentina","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
